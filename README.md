# Just A Grid
## A grid for those who just want a grid

Hello there, and thanks for checking out Just A Grid, the grid for people who just want a grid. 

It's nice to fantasize about our perfect build system, where we have the luxury of choice in terms of what tools we'll use, what conventions we'll follow. However, this is merely a fantasy. The reality of the situation a lot of the time can be simply being told to "make shit responsive", coupling onto the problem is that you've inherited the code base from a completely different team.

At that point, it's an all-hands-on-deck kind of endeavour, and you're doing things you don't ever plan on telling another living soul about, just to get the job done. You've put `!important`s in places you don't even want to talk about.

**This grid is for you**

The grid operates on a simple principle: anything that is declared (via class name) to be a `grid-item` is floated left, and an extra class added such as `desk-3-of-12` indicating how many spaces of the 12-space grid that item occupies in that media query.
